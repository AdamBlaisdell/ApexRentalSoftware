#### What I Learned

This project taught me how to use an iterative approach to project management and software development
as it was developed with a series of sprints using AGILE methodologies.
<br>
I also learned about the importance of proper project planning and organization of file and database structures,
along with the implementation of JavaFX, FXML, a user interface and user documentation.
